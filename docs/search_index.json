[["index.html", "R Programming for Statistical Analysis Chapter 1 Welcome", " R Programming for Statistical Analysis Hammed Akande, Jeff Sauer, Abimbola Ogungbire, Tomiyosi Bola 2021-06-23 Chapter 1 Welcome Thanks for your interest in R Programming for statistical analysis. This is a three-day workshop from June 28 to June 30 (4 PM GMT, 11 AM EDT, 8 AM PDT on all days). This workshop aims to expose early-career scientists to coding and basic statistical analysis in R while fostering collaborations and knowledge sharing among participants. Specifically, we hope this workshop will enable young scholars to build expertise in R and make them competitive in global scholarships. This book is intended to serve as a guide to learning R. Good thing is that the book is (and will be) FREE. So, whether you are attending the workshop live or not, you can always consult this book later on for reference. Please feel free to contribute to this open source project if you would want to add or correct the book. You can submit a pull request on Github or send a the corrections (for example, in R Markdown) and we update the book. As this is only for 3days and limited with time, this workshop will only introduce you to basic coding and statistics and by no means exhaustive. For a more detailed analysis, please refer to online resources or contact any of the workshop facilitators to discuss better.

R is the programming language used for statistical analysis. R Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows for easy programming in R. It is important to note that you can use R without RStudio. However, you can not use RStudio without R. So, I encourage you to download both. 2.1 To download R R is hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) website (https://cran.r-project.org/). Once you are on the CRAN website, you would see three different links to download R. Please consider your computer operating system and select whichever best describes it. For example, if youre using a Windows computer, please click on R for windows. If this is your first time installing R and you have not used R before, please click on the 1st link you see (base- Install R for the first time); otherwise, update your R (if necessary) or download R Studio (see below for a guide on how to do this). If youre using Mac or Linus, follow the same procedure on the CRAN website to download and install R. Once you successfully install R, then you can download R studio. 2.2 To download R Studio To download R Studio, please visit this website (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). Once you click on that link, download the R Studio version recommended for your computer and install it. Once you install R Studio, you can open it, and voila- welcome to the world of programming in R. That is all for all now. If you do not get everything now- dont worry, I will run through it again during the workshop. The aim of giving you this early is to fast-track the process. Feel free to ask questions about the installation on slack or during the workshop- I will be glad to answer.
